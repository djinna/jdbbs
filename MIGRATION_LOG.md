# Migration Log

This file documents the merge of `djinna/prodcal` and `djinna/book-prod` into
`djinna/jdbbs`. It is the source of truth for what was migrated, what was
changed, and what reconciliation work is still open.

## Sources

| Repo | Last commit imported | Date | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`djinna/prodcal`](https://github.com/djinna/prodcal) | `3a8df8a` | 2026-04-24 | Go web app — production calendar, transmittals, book specs, client portals, AgentMail |
| [`djinna/book-prod`](https://github.com/djinna/book-prod) | `a595088` | 2026-03-18 | Typst-based book production pipeline — templates, fonts, conversion scripts |

Both upstream repos are now archival.

## Strategy

**Clean import** (Section 5 Phase 1, Option B in `docs/JDBBS_KICKOFF_PROMPT.md`).
File contents are copied verbatim and the upstream commit SHAs are recorded
here. History is preserved by the original repos remaining read-only on GitHub.

The initial three commits on `main` mirror the kickoff phases:

1. **Import Go server, DB, and embedded SPA from `djinna/prodcal@3a8df8a`** — verbatim copy, no modifications.
2. **Import typesetting templates, fonts, scripts, manuscripts, reference, corrections from `djinna/book-prod@a595088`** — verbatim copy, no modifications.
3. **Phase 2: monorepo path fixes, Dockerfile/Makefile/CI/docs** — see "Phase 2 changes" below.

## Phase 2 changes (path & deployment fixes)

### `srv/books.go`

Replaced the four hardcoded `bookProdRoot = "/home/exedev/book-production"`
constants with a runtime-resolved `typesettingRoot()` helper. Resolution order:

1. `JDBBS_TYPESETTING_DIR` env var
2. `./typesetting` relative to CWD (production layout)
3. Walk up parents looking for a sibling `typesetting/` (so `go test ./srv/...`
   works when CWD is the package dir)
4. Fall back to `./typesetting` (absolute)

Helpers `convertScriptPath()`, `seriesTemplatePath()`, `fontsDirPath()` derive
their paths from `typesettingRoot()`. The `typst compile --root /` flag is
unchanged because the helpers return absolute paths.

### `srv/bookspecs.go`

`generate-word-template.py` and `typst fonts --font-path` paths now resolve
through the same helpers.

### `typesetting/scripts/build-ghosts.sh`

`cd ~/book-production` replaced with a `REPO_ROOT` derivation from the
script's own location. Output paths updated for the monorepo layout
(`src/ghosts/` → `manuscripts/ghosts/`, `templates/series-template.typ` →
`typesetting/templates/series-template.typ`).

The other shell scripts (`md2pdf.sh`, `md2epub.sh`, `docx2pdf.sh`,
`docx2epub.sh`) already used `PROJECT_ROOT="$(dirname "$SCRIPT_DIR")"`, so
they continue to work unchanged when run from inside `typesetting/`.

### Dockerfile

Single-stage build → multi-stage with full typesetting toolchain:
Typst (binary release), Pandoc, python3 + python-docx + pyyaml,
fonts-libertinus, fontconfig, plus the bundled fonts copied into
`/usr/share/fonts/`.

### CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` added — Go 1.26, `go vet`, `go test`. Python
deps (`python-docx`, `pyyaml`) are installed so the word-template
integration test passes; Pandoc is installed for the eventual
PDF/EPUB pipeline tests.

### `srv.service`

Now points at `/home/exedev/jdbbs/jdbbs`. The old `prodcal` working
directory and binary path are gone.

## Open Phase 3 reconciliation items

These need a deliberate decision before being resolved.

### 1. ~~Page-width drift~~ — RESOLVED (Phase 3.1)

Measured the reference PDFs (GHOSTS, LIBRARIANS, TT) and they all report
MediaBox = 353.811 × 546.567 pt = 124.8 × 192.8 mm (= 4.914 × 7.591 in).
No Typst built-in paper size matches this trim, so it's added as a named
publisher preset `protocolized` in the new trim registry
(`srv/bookspecs.go::trimRegistry`).

Changes:

- New trim registry is the single source of truth for named trims. Each
  entry records an optional Typst-built-in name + width/height in inches.
  Keep the admin-side JS mirror (`srv/static/admin.html` `trimPresets` /
  `trimDisplayNames` / `trimCompareData`) in sync with the Go map.
- `defaultSpecData` now ships with `trim: "protocolized"` and the correct
  dimensions.
- `specToTypstConfig` always resolves dimensions through the registry, so a
  stale `width_in`/`height_in` in a saved spec can never disagree with the
  trim name.
- `series-template.typ` keeps width/height as the authoritative fields
  (simpler set-page scoping). The `page-paper` config key remains for
  future use but isn't currently consumed.
- Admin UI exposes the full named list (Typst built-ins + publisher
  presets), shows in/mm in `<option>` labels, and renders in/mm/picas as a
  hover tooltip over the trim-comparison strip and the page preview.

### 2. EPUB generation strategy

Two paths exist:

- `srv/epub.go` — Go handler invoked via `POST /api/books/{id}/generate-epub`.
  Uses spec-driven CSS, cover, metadata.
- `typesetting/scripts/{docx2epub,md2epub}.sh` — Standalone Pandoc wrappers
  with embedded WOFF2 fonts and a fixed CSS.

Both produce EPUB but with different CSS / font handling. Decision needed:

- Keep both (Go = web app, scripts = CLI/batch)? Then make sure they produce
  consistent output.
- Or have the Go handler shell out to the script, so there's a single source
  of truth?

### 3. Corrections wiring

`srv/corrections.go` stores corrections in SQLite and exports YAML.
`typesetting/scripts/apply-corrections.py` consumes that YAML and patches
EPUBs. The two halves are not yet wired: the YAML is a manual export step.

To close: after EPUB generation in `srv/epub.go`, materialize the YAML
in-memory and invoke `apply-corrections.py` to apply pending corrections.
Same for `apply-corrections-docx.py` for Word.

### 4. Libertinus Serif bundling

book-prod assumes Libertinus is system-installed. The Dockerfile installs
`fonts-libertinus` from apt to handle the container case. The exe.dev VM
should be checked: `fc-list | grep -i libertinus`. If absent, install
`fonts-libertinus` (or bundle the fonts in `typesetting/fonts/libertinus/`
for full self-containment).

### 5. `scripts/backup-db.sh` path

The daily cron script still references `/home/exedev/prodcal/db.sqlite3`.
Update to `/home/exedev/jdbbs/db.sqlite3` as part of the VM cutover, and the
in-repo copy here too.

### 6. Server-side drift in `book-production` on the VM

Per the kickoff: check whether the live `/home/exedev/book-production/`
contains uncommitted changes after `book-prod@a595088`. If so, port them in
before declaring this migration complete.

### 7. Phase 4 archive notices

Once the migration is verified live on the VM:

- Add an "ARCHIVED — merged into djinna/jdbbs" banner to
  `djinna/prodcal/README.md` and `djinna/book-prod/README.md`.
- Set both repos to **Archived** in GitHub Settings → Danger Zone.

(Deferred until cutover confirms jdbbs is fully working.)

## Sanity checks performed during scaffold

- `go build -o jdbbs ./cmd/srv` succeeds.
- `go vet ./...` clean.
- `go test ./...` passes (with `python-docx` + `pyyaml` installed locally —
  same condition as in prodcal previously).
- All `srv/static/*` assets load via `//go:embed static/*`.
- All `db/migrations/001`–`011` apply cleanly on a fresh DB.
